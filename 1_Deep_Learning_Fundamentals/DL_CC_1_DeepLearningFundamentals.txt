Module 1 - Introduction to Deep Learning
	Why Deep Learning?
	What is a neural network?
	Three reasons to go Deep
	Your choice of Deep Net
	An old problem: The Vanishing Gradient

@Select the reason(s) for using a Deep Neural Network
 	- Some patterns are very complex and can`t be deciphered precisely by alternate means  
 	- Deep Nets are great at recognizing patterns and using them as building blocks in deciphering inputs  
 	- We finally have the technology - GPUs - to accelerate the training process by several folds of magnitude

 @What is TRUE about the functions of a Multi Layer Perceptron?
	- The first neural nets that were born out of the need to address the inaccuracy of an early classifier, the perceptron.  
	- It predicts which group a given set of inputs falls into.  
	- It generates a score that determines the confidence level of the prediction.  
@Why is the vanishing gradient a problem?
	- Training is quick if the gradient is large and slow if its small.
	- With backprop, the gradient becomes smaller as it works back through the net .
	- The gradient is calculated multiplying two numbers between 0 and 1

Module 2 - Deep Learning Models
	Restricted Boltzmann Machines
	Deep Belief Nets
	Convolutional Networks
	"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC"
	Recurrent Nets

@For Unsupervised Learning, which of the following deep nets would you choose?
	✔Autoencoder or Restricted Boltzmann Machines✔
	Deep Belief Nets  
	Convolutional Nets  
	Recurrent Nets

@The RELU activation has no effect on back-propagation and the vanishing gradient
False: 

@Convolutional Nets are the right model when dealing with data that changes over time because of their built-in feedback loop, allowing them to serve as a forecasting engine.
False

What are the different aspects of a Deep Learning Library?
	- They are a set of pre-built functions and modules that you can call through your own programs  
	- Usually maintained by high-performance teams and are regularly updated  
	- Most are open source and have a large community that contribute to the code base
