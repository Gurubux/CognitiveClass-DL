# Build a linear model with Estimators

This tutorial uses the `tf.estimator` API in TensorFlow to solve a benchmark binary classification problem. Estimators are TensorFlow's most scalable and production-oriented model type. For more information see the [Estimator guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/estimators).

## Overview

Using census data which contains data about a person's age, education, marital status, and occupation (the *features*), we will try to predict whether or not the person earns more than 50,000 dollars a year (the target *label*). We will train a *logistic regression* model that, given an individual's information, outputs a number between 0 and 1â€”this can be interpreted as the probability that the individual has an annual income of over 50,000 dollars.

Key Point: As a modeler and developer, think about how this data is used and the potential benefits and harm a model's predictions can cause. A model like this could reinforce societal biases and disparities. Is each  feature relevant to the problem you want to solve or will it introduce bias? For more information, read about [ML fairness](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/fairness-overview/).

"""## Read the U.S. Census data

This example uses the [U.S Census Income Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income) from 1994 and 1995. We have provided the [census_dataset.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/wide_deep/census_dataset.py) script to download the data and perform a little cleanup.

Since the task is a *binary classification problem*, we'll construct a label column named "label" whose value is 1 if the income is over 50K, and 0 otherwise. For reference, see the `input_fn` in [census_main.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/wide_deep/census_main.py).

Let's look at the data to see which columns we can use to predict the target label:

import pandas

train_df = pandas.read_csv(train_file, header = None, names = census_dataset._CSV_COLUMNS)
test_df = pandas.read_csv(test_file, header = None, names = census_dataset._CSV_COLUMNS)

train_df.head()

"""The columns are grouped into two types: *categorical* and *continuous* columns:

* A column is called *categorical* if its value can only be one of the categories in a finite set. For example, the relationship status of a person (wife, husband, unmarried, etc.) or the education level (high school, college, etc.) are categorical columns.
* A column is called *continuous* if its value can be any numerical value in a continuous range. For example, the capital gain of a person (e.g. $14,084) is a continuous column.

## Converting Data into Tensors

When building a `tf.estimator` model, the input data is specified by using an *input function* (or `input_fn`). This builder function returns a `tf.data.Dataset` of batches of `(features-dict, label)` pairs. It is not called until it is passed to `tf.estimator.Estimator` methods such as `train` and `evaluate`.

The input builder function returns the following pair:

1. `features`: A dict from feature names to `Tensors` or `SparseTensors` containing batches of features.
2. `labels`: A `Tensor` containing batches of labels.

The keys of the `features` are used to configure the model's input layer.

Note: The input function is called while constructing the TensorFlow graph, *not* while running the graph. It is returning a representation of the input data as a sequence of TensorFlow graph operations.

For small problems like this, it's easy to make a `tf.data.Dataset` by slicing the `pandas.DataFrame`:
"""

def easy_input_function(df, label_key, num_epochs, shuffle, batch_size):
  label = df[label_key]
  ds = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((dict(df),label))

  if shuffle:
    ds = ds.shuffle(10000)

  ds = ds.batch(batch_size).repeat(num_epochs)

  return ds

"""Since we have eager execution enabled, it's easy to inspect the resulting dataset:"""

ds = easy_input_function(train_df, label_key='income_bracket', num_epochs=5, shuffle=True, batch_size=10)

for feature_batch, label_batch in ds.take(1):
  print('Some feature keys:', list(feature_batch.keys())[:5])
  print()
  print('A batch of Ages  :', feature_batch['age'])
  print()
  print('A batch of Labels:', label_batch )

"""But this approach has severly-limited scalability. Larger datasets should be streamed from disk. The `census_dataset.input_fn` provides an example of how to do this using `tf.decode_csv` and `tf.data.TextLineDataset`:

<!-- TODO(markdaoust): This `input_fn` should use `tf.contrib.data.make_csv_dataset` -->
"""

import inspect
print(inspect.getsource(census_dataset.input_fn))

  print('Feature keys:', list(feature_batch.keys())[:5])
  print()
  print('Age batch   :', feature_batch['age'])
  print()

"""## Selecting and Engineering Features for the Model

Estimators use a system called [feature columns](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/feature_columns) to describe how the model should interpret each of the raw input features. An Estimator expects a vector of numeric inputs, and feature columns describe how the model should convert each feature.

Selecting and crafting the right set of feature columns is key to learning an effective model. A *feature column* can be either one of the raw inputs in the original features `dict` (a *base feature column*), or any new columns created using transformations defined over one or multiple base columns (a *derived feature columns*).

A feature column is an abstract concept of any raw or derived variable that can be used to predict the target label.

### Base Feature Columns

#### Numeric columns

The simplest `feature_column` is `numeric_column`. This indicates that a feature is a numeric value that should be input to the model directly. For example:
"""

age = fc.numeric_column('age')

"""The model will use the `feature_column` definitions to build the model input. You can inspect the resulting output using the `input_layer` function:"""

fc.input_layer(feature_batch, [age]).numpy()

"""The following will train and evaluate a model using only the `age` feature:"""

classifier = tf.estimator.LinearClassifier(feature_columns=[age])
classifier.train(train_inpf)
result = classifier.evaluate(test_inpf)

clear_output()  # used for display in notebook
print(result)

"""Similarly, we can define a `NumericColumn` for each continuous feature column
that we want to use in the model:
"""

education_num = tf.feature_column.numeric_column('education_num')
capital_gain = tf.feature_column.numeric_column('capital_gain')
capital_loss = tf.feature_column.numeric_column('capital_loss')
hours_per_week = tf.feature_column.numeric_column('hours_per_week')

my_numeric_columns = [age,education_num, capital_gain, capital_loss, hours_per_week]

fc.input_layer(feature_batch, my_numeric_columns).numpy()

"""You could retrain a model on these features by changing the `feature_columns` argument to the constructor:"""

classifier = tf.estimator.LinearClassifier(feature_columns=my_numeric_columns)
classifier.train(train_inpf)

result = classifier.evaluate(test_inpf)

clear_output()

for key,value in sorted(result.items()):
  print('%s: %s' % (key, value))

"""#### Categorical columns

To define a feature column for a categorical feature, create a `CategoricalColumn` using one of the `tf.feature_column.categorical_column*` functions.

If you know the set of all possible feature values of a columnâ€”and there are only a few of themâ€”use `categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list`. Each key in the list is assigned an auto-incremented ID starting from 0. For example, for the `relationship` column we can assign the feature string `Husband` to an integer ID of 0 and "Not-in-family" to 1, etc.
"""

relationship = fc.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list(
    'relationship',
    ['Husband', 'Not-in-family', 'Wife', 'Own-child', 'Unmarried', 'Other-relative'])

"""This creates a sparse one-hot vector from the raw input feature.

The `input_layer` function we're using is designed for DNN models and expects dense inputs. To demonstrate the categorical column we must wrap it in a `tf.feature_column.indicator_column` to create the dense one-hot output (Linear `Estimators` can often skip this dense-step).

Note: the other sparse-to-dense option is `tf.feature_column.embedding_column`.

Run the input layer, configured with both the `age` and `relationship` columns:
"""

fc.input_layer(feature_batch, [age, fc.indicator_column(relationship)])

"""If we don't know the set of possible values in advance, use the `categorical_column_with_hash_bucket` instead:"""

occupation = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_hash_bucket(
    'occupation', hash_bucket_size=1000)

"""Here, each possible value in the feature column `occupation` is hashed to an integer ID as we encounter them in training. The example batch has a few different occupations:"""

for item in feature_batch['occupation'].numpy():
    print(item.decode())

"""If we run `input_layer` with the hashed column, we see that the output shape is `(batch_size, hash_bucket_size)`:"""

occupation_result = fc.input_layer(feature_batch, [fc.indicator_column(occupation)])

occupation_result.numpy().shape

"""It's easier to see the actual results if we take the `tf.argmax` over the `hash_bucket_size` dimension. Notice how any duplicate occupations are mapped to the same pseudo-random index:"""

tf.argmax(occupation_result, axis=1).numpy()

"""Note: Hash collisions are unavoidable, but often have minimal impact on model quality. The effect may be noticable if the hash buckets are being used to compress the input space. See [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/models/blob/master/samples/outreach/blogs/housing_prices.ipynb) for a more visual example of the effect of these hash collisions.

No matter how we choose to define a `SparseColumn`, each feature string is mapped into an integer ID by looking up a fixed mapping or by hashing. Under the hood, the `LinearModel` class is responsible for managing the mapping and creating `tf.Variable` to store the model parameters (model *weights*) for each feature ID. The model parameters are learned through the model training process described later.

Let's do the similar trick to define the other categorical features:
"""

education = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list(

        'Bachelors', 'HS-grad', '11th', 'Masters', '9th', 'Some-college',
        'Assoc-acdm', 'Assoc-voc', '7th-8th', 'Doctorate', 'Prof-school',
        '5th-6th', '10th', '1st-4th', 'Preschool', '12th'])

marital_status = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list(
    'marital_status', [

"""It's easy to use both sets of columns to configure a model that uses all these features:"""

"""### Derived feature columns

#### Make Continuous Features Categorical through Bucketization

Sometimes the relationship between a continuous feature and the label is not linear. For example, *age* and *income*â€”a person's income may grow in the early stage of their career, then the growth may slow at some point, and finally, the income decreases after retirement. In this scenario, using the raw `age` as a real-valued feature column might not be a good choice because the model can only learn one of the three cases:

1.  Income always increases at some rate as age grows (positive correlation),
2.  Income always decreases at some rate as age grows (negative correlation), or
3.  Income stays the same no matter at what age (no correlation).

If we want to learn the fine-grained correlation between income and each age group separately, we can leverage *bucketization*. Bucketization is a process of dividing the entire range of a continuous feature into a set of consecutive buckets, and then converting the original numerical feature into a bucket ID (as a categorical feature) depending on which bucket that value falls into. So, we can define a `bucketized_column` over `age` as:
"""

age_buckets = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
    age, boundaries=[18, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65])

"""`boundaries` is a list of bucket boundaries. In this case, there are 10 boundaries, resulting in 11 age group buckets (from age 17 and below, 18-24, 25-29, ..., to 65 and over).

With bucketing, the model sees each bucket as a one-hot feature:
"""

fc.input_layer(feature_batch, [age, age_buckets]).numpy()

"""#### Learn complex relationships with crossed column

Using each base feature column separately may not be enough to explain the data. For example, the correlation between education and the label (earning > 50,000 dollars) may be different for different occupations. Therefore, if we only learn a single model weight for `education="Bachelors"` and `education="Masters"`, we won't capture every education-occupation combination (e.g. distinguishing between `education="Bachelors"` AND `occupation="Exec-managerial"` AND `education="Bachelors" AND occupation="Craft-repair"`).

To learn the differences between different feature combinations, we can add *crossed feature columns* to the model:
"""

education_x_occupation = tf.feature_column.crossed_column(
    ['education', 'occupation'], hash_bucket_size=1000)

"""We can also create a `crossed_column` over more than two columns. Each constituent column can be either a base feature column that is categorical (`SparseColumn`), a bucketized real-valued feature column, or even another `CrossColumn`. For example:"""

age_buckets_x_education_x_occupation = tf.feature_column.crossed_column(
    [age_buckets, 'education', 'occupation'], hash_bucket_size=1000)

"""These crossed columns always use hash buckets to avoid the exponential explosion in the number of categories, and put the control over number of model weights in the hands of the user.

For a visual example the effect of hash-buckets with crossed columns see [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/models/blob/master/samples/outreach/blogs/housing_prices.ipynb)

## Define the logistic regression model

After processing the input data and defining all the feature columns, we can put them together and build a *logistic regression* model. The previous section showed several types of base and derived feature columns, including:

*   `CategoricalColumn`
*   `NumericColumn`
*   `BucketizedColumn`
*   `CrossedColumn`

All of these are subclasses of the abstract `FeatureColumn` class and can be added to the `feature_columns` field of a model:

## Adding Regularization to Prevent Overfitting

Regularization is a technique used to avoid overfitting. Overfitting happens when a model performs well on the data it is trained on, but worse on test data that the model has not seen before. Overfitting can occur when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observed training data. Regularization allows you to control the model's complexity and make the model more generalizable to unseen data.
