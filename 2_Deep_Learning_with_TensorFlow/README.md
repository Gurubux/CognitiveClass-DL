## What is Deep Learning?<br>
<b>Brief Theory:</b> Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning, hierarchical learning or deep machine learning) is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model high-level abstractions in data by using multiple processing layers, with complex structures or otherwise, composed of multiple non-linear transformations.<br>

<b>In Practice, defining the term "Deep":</b> in this context, deep means that we are studying a Neural Network which has several hidden layers (more than one), no matter what type (convolutional, pooling, normalization, fully-connected etc). The most interesting part is that some papers noticed that Deep Neural Networks with the right architectures/hyper-parameters achieve better results than shallow Neural Networks with the same computational power (e.g. number of neurons or connections). <br><br>
<b>In Practice, defining "Learning":</b> In the context of supervised learning, digits recognition in our case, the learning part consists of a target/feature which is to be predicted using a given set of observations with the already known final prediction (label). In our case, the target will be the digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and the observations are the intensity and relative position of the pixels. After some training, it is possible to generate a "function" that map inputs (digit image) to desired outputs(type of digit). The only problem is how well this map operation occurs. While trying to generate this "function", the training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data.<br>
