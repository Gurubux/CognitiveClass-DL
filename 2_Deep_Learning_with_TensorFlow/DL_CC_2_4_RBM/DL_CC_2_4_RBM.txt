MODULE 4 - UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
Restricted Boltzmann Machines
- Find the patterns in data in an "unsupervised" manner.
- Shallow neural nets that learn to reconstruct data by themselves
- Unsupervised
- Feature extraction
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Pattern recognition, 
- Recommender systems, 
- Handling missing values, 
- Topic modeling
Deep Belief Network
- Built on top of RBMs
- Solves back-propagation problem, "Local-minima" and "vanishing gradients"
- Solve this by the stacking of multiple RBMs
- Classification
- Image recognition
- A very accurate discriminative classifier - As such, we donâ€™t need a big set of labeled data to train a Deep Belief Network; in fact, a small set works fine because feature extraction is unsupervised by a stack of RBMs.

QUIZ
@Select the True statement about Restricted means in RBM?
 - It is a Boltzmann machine, but with no connections between nodes in the same layer  
 - Each node in the first layer has a bias.  
 - The RBM reconstructs data by making several forward and backward passes between the visible and hidden layers.  
 - At the hidden layer`s nodes, X is multiplied by a W (weight matrix) and added to h_bias.

@
- The objective function is to maximize the likelihood of our data being drawn from the reconstructed data distribution  
- The Negative phase of RBM decreases the probability of samples generated by the model.  
- Contrastive Divergence (CD) is used to approximate the negative phase of RBM.  
- The Positive phase of RBM increases the probability of training data.
